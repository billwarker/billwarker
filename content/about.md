A place to upload notes as I study data science/products, machine learning, math in general (lots of catching up to do). By publishing these notes online they'll be easier for me to revisit and reference, plus I can show them to *you* (assuming you are not me).

# A Brief Introduction

I'm Will, and here's a picture of me with some friends I made while travelling in India. I'm hopeful that someday the skills I learn in tech will help make folks' lives all across the world a little bit easier - at the end of the day, we're all in the same boat!

# Food for Thought

*It is more important to ask interesting questions, not give precise answers to boring ones.*

*"What happens in a man’s life is already written. A man must move through life as his destiny wills.“*

*"Yes, but each man is free to live as he chooses. Though they seem opposite, both are true”.*
