The Standard Error of the Mean ($SE$) is the standard deviation of the sample distribution of the sample mean. To understand what this means, let&rsquo;s break that sentence down in reverse order (i.e. chronologically):
Sample Mean: we have some probability density function $P$ for a population. We take a sample of $N$ instances from it and calculate our statistic of interest - in this case the mean, $\bar{x}$. We have to take samples because it is hard/impossible to look at every instance in an entire population to calculate the true mean $\mu$ hidden to us in nature (i.e. say we were interested in the average weight of all monkeys on the planet).
Sample Distribution: we take many samples (the number of which denoted by $M$) from the population&rsquo;s probability density function $P$ and calculate the sample mean $\bar{x}$ for each one. All of these sample means can be lumped together into a distribution $S$, which approximates a normal distribution the higher $M$ is due to the Central Limit Theorum. We want to create a sampling distribution because it allows us to reason about the likelihood of different values the sample mean can be. By doing so, we can look at the mean of this distribution and conclude that its the most likely value for $\mu$ given the data we&rsquo;ve used.
Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is a metric that describes the dispersion of a dataset/distribution in relation to its mean. It speaks to how close/far the density of the distribution is spread in relation to its mean. The standard deviation of a sample distribution - our standard error $SE$ - is an indication of how representative the distribution is of our true mean $\mu$. The smaller it is, the more representative it can be said to be; the larger it is, the harder it is to trust.
TLDR: The Standard Error matters because it allows us to better understand how representative our sampling distribution is (i.e. our model of the true mean)." />
